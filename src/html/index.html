                                    SUBMISSIONS TO US. We will use MARKUS for the submission of all assignments.
                                    A STRICT silent policy takes effect 12 hours before an ASSIGNMENT or EXAM is
                                    due. This means that the teaching staff will answer no questions about the assignment</p></li>
                                <li><p>We will follow the due dates mentioned in the course syllabus. However, if the due dates

                                <li><p>If a piece of work has been mismarked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the
                                    work is not appropriate, you may request a remark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must
                                    clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked or unfairly marked. To
                                    request a remark, set up an appointment with the instructor and the TA that has marked
                                    your assignment/exam.</p></li>

                                    down after the re-evaluation. Remark requests MUST be made 48 hours after the mark
                                    is made available. No remark request will be accepted after 48 hours.</p></li>

                                <li><p>For some of the assignments, you have the option of working in group of two or three
                                    and we encourage you to do so. Each group may contain up to a maximum of 3 people
                                    including yourself from your own section. You may choose your own partners and it
                                    does not need be the same person for each assignment. Once you begin working on an
                                    assignment, you may not dissolve your partnership without my permission. All team
                                    members will receive the same mark.</p></li>
                                <li><p>
                                    Some assignments may require group of two while other assignments might require
group of 3. Details will be mentioned in each Assignment handout.
                                </p></li>

                                        Working with a partner has the potential to lighten your workload or to increase it,
depending on how well you work together. Remember that you are responsible for
learning the course material underlying all parts of the assignments. You will have the
most success if you truly work together.

                                Academic integrity / plagiarism
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                All the work you submit must be your own and your work must not be submitted by
someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken seriously. The department uses
software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and
Regulations from the U of T Calendar (especially the Code of Behavior on Academic
Matters).
Please do not cheat. It is unpleasant for everyone involved, including us. Here are a couple
of general guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Never look at another studentâ€™s assignment solution, whether it is on paper or on
the computer screen.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>Never show another student your assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of
                                    a solution and to incomplete solutions.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to only discuss the assignment with the
                                    CSCB20 TA, and your instructor.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Getting any component of the solution (including a verbal step-
                                    by-step explanation of how to do it) from another student, social-networking apps
                                    e.g. WeChat, Discord or â€˜Mentoringâ€™ services, etc. is an academic offense.</p></li>
