                                    There are three assignments. You may be asked to work in pairs on some of these
                                    assignments. Please check the assignment handout for more details on whether working
                                    in pairs is permitted or not; other details such as the exact due date will also be
                                    mentioned on the assignment handout. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENT
                                    SUBMISSIONS TO US. We will use MARKUS for the submission of all assignments.
                                    A STRICT silent policy takes effect 12 hours before an ASSIGNMENT or EXAM is

                                    If a piece of work has been mismarked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the
                                    work is not appropriate, you may request a remark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must
                                    clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked or unfairly marked. To
                                    request a remark, set up an appointment with the instructor and the TA that has marked
                                    your assignment/exam.

                                    For some of the assignments, you have the option of working in group of two or three
                                    and we encourage you to do so. Each group may contain up to a maximum of 3 people
                                    including yourself from your own section. You may choose your own partners and it
                                    does not need be the same person for each assignment. Once you begin working on an
                                    assignment, you may not dissolve your partnership without my permission. All team
                                    members will receive the same mark.
                                </p>

                                    Some assignments may require group of two while other assignments might require
                                    group of 3. Details will be mentioned in each Assignment handout.

                                    Working with a partner has the potential to lighten your workload or to increase it,
                                    depending on how well you work together. Remember that you are responsible for
                                    learning the course material underlying all parts of the assignments. You will have the
                                    most success if you truly work together.

                        <h3>Academic integrity / plagiarism</h3>
                        <p>
                            All the work you submit must be your own and your work must not be submitted by
                            someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken seriously. The department uses
                            software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and
                            Regulations from the U of T Calendar (especially the Code of Behavior on Academic
                            Matters).
                            Please do not cheat. It is unpleasant for everyone involved, including us. Here are a couple
                            of general guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Never look at another studentâ€™s assignment solution, whether it is on paper or on
                                    the computer screen.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Never show another student your assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of
                                    a solution and to incomplete solutions.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to only discuss the assignment with the
                                    CSCB20 TA, and your instructor.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Getting any component of the solution (including a verbal step-
                                    by-step explanation of how to do it) from another student, social-networking apps
                                    e.g. WeChat, Discord or â€˜Mentoringâ€™ services, etc. is an academic offense.

                                    Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
